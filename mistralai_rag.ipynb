    "# Goal: Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
    "- **Overview**: After completing this tutorial, you'll have learned how to build an indexing pipeline that will preprocess files based on their file type, using the `FileTypeRouter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 (Optional): After creating the indexing pipeline in this tutorial, there is an optional section that shows you how to create a RAG pipeline on top of the document store you just created. You must have a [Hugging Face API Key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) for this section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`FileTypeRouter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/filetyperouter): This component will help you route files based on their corresponding MIME type to different components\n",
    "- [`MarkdownToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/markdowntodocument): This component will help you convert markdown files into Haystack Documents\n",
    "- [`PyPDFToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pypdftodocument): This component will help you convert pdf files into Haystack Documents\n",
    "- [`TextFileToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/textfiletodocument): This component will help you convert text files into Haystack Documents\n",
    "- [`DocumentJoiner`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentjoiner): This component will help you to join Documents coming from different branches of a pipeline\n",
    "- [`DocumentCleaner`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentcleaner) (optional): This component will help you to make Documents more readable by removing extra whitespaces etc.\n",
    "- [`DocumentSplitter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentsplitter): This component will help you to split your Document into chunks\n",
    "- [`SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformersdocumentembedder): This component will help you create embeddings for Documents.\n",
    "- [`DocumentWriter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentwriter): This component will help you write Documents into the DocumentStore"
